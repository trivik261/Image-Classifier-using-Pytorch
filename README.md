# Image Classifier Using Pytorch

In this project, we'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower our camera is looking at. In practice we'd train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We'll be using a dataset of 102 flower categories available on the website of Oxford University.
